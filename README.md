# [my bookshelf](https://schkayla.github.io/my-bookshelf/ "my bookshelf")

I like reading, so this is a way to keep track of books I've read, including title, author, date added, if I've read it, # of pages, and rating (if I've read it). I've used Goodreads to track my book reading, and they have a reading challenge where you can set a goal to read a certain number of books in a year, but I'd rather have a reading challenge based on number of pages read instead of number of books read. I used Google Sheets as my database and an API hosted on Heroku.
