# [my bookshelf](https://schkayla.github.io/my-bookshelf/ "my bookshelf")

Since I read often, I've been looking for a good way to store the books I've read and want to read. The plan is to use Google Sheets as a database to store my list, and be able to add/remove books from a form. I'm also going to add functionality in selecting, 'want to read' or 'have read' (if I've read the book, then I get the option to rate the book, and the thumb rating appears on the card). Later I also want to add a search feature to search by title or author, a way to filter books I've read by ones I haven't, and a filter by year the book was added.
